Place your custom modules here. Currently only modules for adding custom headers are supported. Simply place yur module inside here and add the folder name to your config under `['modules']['headers']`. The module must contain a `main.php` returning an array with all additional headers. See <https://github.com/e1mo/git-version-headers> for an verry basic example.
